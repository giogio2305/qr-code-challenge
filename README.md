### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
      <figure class="card__image-container">
        <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code Image" class="card__image">
      </figure>
```
```css
.card__image-container {
    width: 100%;
    height: 56%;
    border-radius: 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
.card__image {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Understanding the CSS BEM convention](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css/understanding-the-css-bem-convention/) - This helped me for CSS naming convention and code structure. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Semantic HTML5 Elements Explained](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/semantic-html5-elements/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Semantic HTML5 markup. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
